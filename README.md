Elementary CFD codes in Python 

list of equations thus far:
  - 2-D advection_diffusion equation using explicit finite difference scheme (from Dr. Barba 12 steps)
      1. vectorized 1 for loop_ integrating time
      2. not vectorized 3 for loops time and spatial
    Future plan: generalize the solver for enable only heat equation, or convection equation with various boundary condition
    
    
  - 2-D Laplace equation
      1. Using Gauss-Seidal/Liebmann method
      2. Jacobi iterative method
     Future plan: make it general for it to be able solve with source term and various boundary conditions.
